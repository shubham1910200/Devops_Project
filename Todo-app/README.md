## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.10** (or higher)
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized environment)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubham1910200/Devops_Project.git
cd Devops_Project/Todo-app
```

### Install Dependencies

Once inside the `Todo-app` directory, install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all necessary Python packages, including **Flask**.

## Running the Application

### Run with Python

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application locally using Python:

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will be accessible at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### Run with Docker

If you prefer to run the application inside a Docker container:

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t soma1999/todo-app .
```

2. Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 soma1999/todo-app
```

The app will be accessible at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Running Tests

To ensure everything is working, you can run the unit tests for the application.

### Run Tests Locally

If you want to run the tests locally:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

### Run Tests in Docker

Alternatively, you can run the tests inside the Docker container:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app soma1999/todo-app:latest python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```
